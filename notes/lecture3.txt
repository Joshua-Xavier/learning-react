Pure functions:
Evaluates the same result given the same arguments
Doesn't depend on and doesn't modify the states of variables out
of its scope. For instance difference between slice and splice.

Slice will create shallow copy and modifying copy
Splice is not pure as it modifies the arguments

Can pass props to components via:
<Component prop1="blah" prop2="bleh" ... />
And you can access these props via {this.props.prop1} etc within your views

A good way to think about all this is:
f(d) = v
Your components are functions that take in data and return a view

Everything returned from a render must be wrapped in one root element.
If you've got many components put together then you should put a div around
them.

Compare all components against FIRST acronym, your components should be:

- Focused
- Independent
- Reusable
- Small
- Testable
